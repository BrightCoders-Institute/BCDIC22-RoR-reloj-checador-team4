# Description

What did you implemented/Why did you implemented this:

- Explain the changes you’ve made.
- It doesn’t need to be fancy and you don’t have to get to technical, yet.
- Just explicit what you have implemented at a high level.
- Let the reviewer know the overall effect of the PR.
- Reference a ticket in your issue tracker. Explain what the change is and then and only then reference the ticket.
- The “why” is a chance to explain both the engineering goal, but also a some business objective that is satisfied or moved along.

Examples:

- What?: I've added support for authentication to implement Key Result 2 of OKR1. It includes
model, table, controller and test. For more background, see ticket #JIRA-123.
- Why?: These changes complete the user login and account creation experience. See #JIRA-123 for more information.

## Testing

Help me how can I test or look at the changes

 Example:

- I've added coverage for testing all new methods. I used Faker for a few random user emails and names.

## Screenshots

If applicable, include screenshots of the results or screenshots that help to see changes
